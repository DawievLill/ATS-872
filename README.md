# Advanced Time Series 872 

These course notes are for the section on Bayesian econometrics. Incomplete, but frequently updated. 

The notebooks folder contains all the `Pluto` notebooks for this class. To get started with Pluto, please visit the [Github page](https://github.com/fonsp/Pluto.jl) or watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOjKEgbt8AI)  

# Rough course outline

0. Introduction to Julia from [QuantEcon](https://julia.quantecon.org/getting_started_julia/index.html) -- **Complete** ✔️
1. Sampling, random variables and distributions -- [Lecture #1 Notebook](https://dawievlill.github.io/pluto-static-export/lecture1-sampling.html)
2. Bayesian thinking (Bernoulli / Binomial) -- **Final Draft** ✔️ [R code available]
3. Starting with simulation (Normal) -- **Final Draft** ✔️ [R code available]
4. Markov chain Monte Carlo -- **Final Draft** ✔️
5. Bayesian linear regression -- **First Draft** ✔️
6. Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVARs) -- **Final Draft** ✔️ [Basic R code available]
7. Large BVARS -- **Empty** ❌ (Will not cover this year) 
8. State space modelling and TVP-VARs -- **Empty** ❌ (Will not cover this year)
9. Kalman filter -- **Empty** ❌ (Will not cover this year)

`R` code for many of the lectures will also be uploaded, for those that are more comfortable using `R`. However, the main programming language for this course will be `Julia`. No familiarity with `Julia` is assumed. We will be starting from basic principles.
