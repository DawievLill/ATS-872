# Advanced Time Series 872 

These course notes are for the section on Bayesian econometrics. Incomplete, but frequently updated. 

The notebooks folder contains all the `Pluto.jl` notebooks for this class.

# Rough course outline

0. Introduction to Julia
1. Sampling, random variables and distributions
2. Bayesian thinking (Bernoulli / Binomial)
3. Gauss is everywhere (Normal) 
4. Markov chain Monte Carlo
5. Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and `Turing.jl`
6. Bayesian linear regression
7. Bayesian Vector Autoregression (BVAR)
8. Time Varying Parameter VARs (TVP-VAR) (**time permitting**)
9. Kalman filter (**time permitting**)

`R` code for many of the lectures will also be uploaded, for those that are more comfortable using `R`. However, the main programming language for this course will be `Julia`. No familiarity with `Julia` is assumed. We will be starting from basic principles.
