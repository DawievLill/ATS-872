## Exercise 1: Write a function that generates a draw from a random variable that has a binomial distribution.

# The binomial random variable Y ~ Bin(n, p) represents the number of successes in n binary trials where each trial succeeds with probability p. Use the runif() command to write a function called binomial_rv that generates one draw of Y.

# Hint: If U is uniform on (0, 1) and p âˆˆ (0, 1) then the expression U < p evaluates to true with probability p

binomial_rv <- function(n, p) {
  # Write the function body here
  k <- 0
  # for () {
    # if () {
      # 
    }
  }
  return(k)
}
